# Email Scraper Tool

## Overview

The Email Scraper Tool is a Node.js-based web application that allows users to quickly find email addresses on websites. This tool is especially useful for frequent online shoppers or anyone who regularly needs to find contact information for support or inquiries. Simply enter a list of website URLs, and the app will scrape each site for any visible email addresses, displaying them on the same page for easy access.

## Motivation

After the COVID-19 pandemic, my wife and I increasingly relied on online shopping for various essentials. However, we often found it challenging to locate customer support email addresses on these websites when we had issues with products or services. Manually searching for contact information was time-consuming, so I built this tool to automate the process of finding email addresses on websites.

## Features

- Scrapes email addresses from multiple URLs simultaneously.
- Easy-to-use web interface with a form to input URLs.
- Displays scraped email addresses on the same page.
- Provides feedback while scraping (e.g., loading message).
- Built with Node.js, Express, Axios, and Cheerio for efficient web scraping.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript, CSS
- **Libraries**:
  - `axios` for making HTTP requests
  - `cheerio` for parsing HTML
  - `body-parser` for handling form data
